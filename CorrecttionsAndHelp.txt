Corrections and Help for Assignment3
====================================

Correction to Type.java
    The constructor for the new class Type.UntypedNumber was missing
    a call to the private method checkForm().
    You should either download the corrected copy of Type.java or
    insert the line
          checkForm();
    as the very last statement in the class constructo.

Help with learning the Go type system:
    The Go language provides a way to discover what type is being used by
    the compiler for a variable.

    For example, what is the type of x here? You can paste this code into
    the code window of https://golang.org/# and click Run. The %T format
    displays the name of the type.

		package main
		import "fmt"

		var x = 5.1 * 10
		
		func main() {
			fmt.Printf("%T\n", x)
		}
